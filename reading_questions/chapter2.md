#Chapter 2

###1) Give a real-world example of virtualization (ideally not one of the ones in the book).
Taking prescription medicine is an example of virtualization. You are likely not aware of how the prescription medicine functions at a molecular level inside your body, but your doctor told you that the medicine is expected to relieve your symptoms.

###2) What is the difference between a program and a process?
A process is a software object that represents a running program. Essentially, a process is a program that is executed. This allows you to run a program in isolation and not worry about program to program interactions.

###3) What is the primary purpose of the process abstraction? What illusion does the process abstraction create?
Process abstraction allows the programmer to not have to worry about interaction with other programs. It provides a number of features such as multitasking, virtual memory, and device abstraction that allow processes to run in isolation. 

###4) What is the kernel?
The kernel is the part of the operating system that is responsible for the core tasks such as creating threads.

###5) What is a daemon?
A daemon is a process that runs in the background and provides operating system services.
