# Reflection 0

by David Papp

Team formation went smoother than I expected. We initially formed with the intention of learning very low level tricks in C for optimization purposes, but strayed away from this as we brainstormed ideas. None of us were adamant in this topic, so we strayed towards graphics and algorithms. 
To come up with a project topic, we assigned ourselves the task of coming up with 3 ideas each by the next day. We posted these ideas on Trello and voted for our favorites. We unanimously decided to make a Rubik's cube solver. Again, this went smoother and expected and there were no clashes of interest.
We used Trello throughout to help with team planning. We posted our brainstorms on Trello, kept track of what everyone hoped to research by the next meeting, and moved cards appropriately. Our contributions on Trello were distributed evenly. We chose Philip as the scrum master, since he was the first one to volunteer and none of us had any objections.
We still have confusion regarding what language to use and what the scope of our project should be. We are unsure whether we want to use C or C++ (for using OpenGL to solve a Rubik's Cube). However, we are on the right track towards figuring this out. We each assigned ourselves research to experiment with graphics, look into the limitations of each implementation, and figure out what's a reasonable difficulty for the project. By the next meeting, we will have played enough with OpenGL, C, and C++ to make a decision. I've already created a representation of a Rubik's cube in C++ using OpenGL. Overall, I think our project is on the right track and our team has a great dynamic.
