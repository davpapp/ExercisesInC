Reflection:
3) One thing that slowed me down was the fact that the indexing for argv[] depends on whether there 
is an option entered. I did not notice this at first, and this created many corrupt files. I implemented a 
solution that likely is not the most elegant.
Another thing that slowed me down was reading and opening files. I wasn't sure how to copy the contents besides
reading each word and writing it. Also, in my solution, I open, close, and reopen the input file a number of times.
A more elegant approach would be to open all files simultaneously, store them in an array of pointers, and iterate 
the words in the input file. This would eliminate the need to close and reopen the input file.

4) I couldn't find the source code for the real tee.c, just the documentation. The real tee has more options and better 
error checking. My solution is scrappy in comparison and relies on a few hacks to get it working.
